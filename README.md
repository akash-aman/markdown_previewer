## **Idea about building this Project**

- My curiosity 🤓 about markdown❤️ made this project. 
- I was just searching for a full fledged secured🔐 Solution for bringing markdown from server and rendering into HTML.
- As i seen some of package 📦 support only few markdown format and other do not have support for plugin🔌 to bring those features.
- features like fully custom component, math ➗ equations support, mermaid code to diagram 💎 support were missing due to security issues. 
- I have tried to implement all features 🎉. and also sanatized🔫 converted html before render.
